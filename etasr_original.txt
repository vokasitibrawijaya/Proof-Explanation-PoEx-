ABSTRACT
Federated learning faces challenges in explainability and trust when aggregating models from
heterogeneous nodes. This paper proposes FedXChain, a framework combining Federated-SHAP for
privacy-preserving explainability, Node-Specific Divergence Scores (NSDS) for preserving local
interpretability, adaptive trust-based aggregation, and blockchain-verified audit trails. Experimental
results demonstrate improved balance between global performance and node-specific explanation fidelity
compared to FedAvg and FedProx baselines.
Keywords : Federated learning, Explainable AI, Blockchain, SHAP, Trust-based aggregation, Adaptive

INTRODUCTION

Federated learning [1] has emerged as a paradigm for
privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning, enabling
multiple parties to train models without sharing raw data. By
keeping data distributed across edge devices or institutions,
federated learning addresses privacy concerns in sensitive
domains such as healthcare, finance, and IoT. However, the
distributed nature introduces significant challenges in model
interpretability, trust among participants, and verification of
aggregation processes. Unlike centralized learning where
model decisions can be audited directly, federated systems
aggregate updates from heterogeneous nodes with potentially

conflicting objectives and data distributions. Explainability in
federated settings remains an open challenge due to several
factors. First, privacy constraints prevent direct inspection of
local data and models, making traditional explainability
techniques difficult to apply. Second, heterogeneity across
nodes—in terms of data distribution, computational resources,
and model architectures—leads to divergent local explanations
that may not align with global model behavior. Third, the lack
of transparency in aggregation mechanisms raises trust issues:
participants cannot verify whether their contributions are fairly
weighted or whether malicious nodes manipulate the global
model.

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

Several recent studies highlight the growing need for
combining privacy, explainability, and verifiable trust in
distributed learning systems [3]-[9], [20]-[23]. For instance,
Kairouz et al. [20] outlined open challenges in federated
learning under heterogeneous conditions, while Zhang et al.
[21] proposed differential privacy mechanisms for trustworthy
model sharing. Similarly, Lin et al. [22] emphasized blockchain
integration as a mechanism to ensure traceable and auditable
training workflows. Rieke et al. [23] discussed explainable and
trustworthy federated AI systems in healthcare, underscoring
the societal impact of verifiable models. These challenges
motivate the integration of explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI), federated optimization, and blockchain technologies
into unified frameworks that ensure both accuracy and
interpretability.
We introduce FedXChain, a framework that addresses these
gaps through four key contributions: (1) Federated-SHAP
aggregation for privacy-preserving feature importance
synthesis across nodes, (2) Node-Specific Divergence Scores
(NSDS) to quantify and preserve local explanation fidelity, (3)
adaptive trust-based aggregation that dynamically weights node
contributions based on performance, explainability quality, and
consistency, and (4) blockchain-verified audit trails for
immutable logging of XAI artifacts and aggregation decisions.
Our experiments demonstrate that FedXChain achieves
competitive global accuracy while maintaining higher local
interpretability compared to FedAvg and FedProx baselines.

NOTATION AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

A. Notation
Let N = {1, 2, . . . , 𝑁} denote the set of 𝑁 participating
nodes in the federated system. At round 𝑡, a subset C𝑡 ⊆ N of
clients are selected for aggregation. Each node 𝑖 holds a local
𝑛𝑖
dataset 𝒟𝑖 = {(𝒳𝑗 , 𝒴𝑗 )}𝑗=1
with 𝑛i samples. The global model
parameters are denoted 𝐰 ∈ ℝ𝑑 , and node 𝑖’s local update is
(𝑡)
(𝑡)
𝐰𝒊 . Let 𝐬𝒊 ∈ ℝ𝑑 represent node 𝑖’s SHAP feature
importance vector at round 𝑡. Trust score for node 𝑖 is 𝑇𝑖 ∈ [0,
1], and adaptive aggregation weight is 𝜆𝑖 ≥ 0 with ∑𝑖∈𝑐𝑡 𝜆𝑖 = 1
B. Problem Statement

Given heterogeneous node datasets {𝐷𝑖 }𝑁
𝑖=1 with non
IID distributions, our goal is to learn a global model w*
that:
1. Minimizes

This multi-objective formulation balances accuracy,
interpretability, fairness, and transparency challenges not
jointly addressed by existing federated learning frameworks.

RELATED WORK AND STATE OF THE ART

A. Federated Learning and Aggregation Strategies
The foundational FedAvg algorithm [1] aggregates local
model updates via simple weighted averaging based on dataset
sizes. While effective for IID data, FedAvg suffers
performance degradation under non-IID distributions common
in real-world scenarios. FedProx [4] addresses this by adding a
proximal term to regularize local updates toward the global
model, improving convergence in heterogeneous settings.
Beyond these methods, newer algorithms such as FedDyn
[24], FedNova [25], and Scaffold [26] address gradient drift
under non-IID data conditions. Trust-based approaches such as
FLTrust [9] and FLTrust++ [27] improve robustness by
assigning reputation scores based on historical model
performance. However, these methods focus primarily on
robustness and fairness, without integrating explainability or
auditability into aggregation.
B. Explainable AI in Centralized and Federated Settings
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [2] remains a
standard framework for feature-level interpretability in
centralized models. Extensions to federated learning introduce
new explainability mechanisms such as FedXAI [11],
attention-based ExFL [12], and FedSHAP [13] that
incorporate explainable aggregation techniques. In addition,
model-agnostic interpretability approaches such as LIME [28],
DeepSHAP [29], and IG-FL [30] enable interpretability across
diverse architectures. These studies indicate a trend toward
integrating local explanation quality metrics into federated
optimization. Despite these advancements, current frameworks
do not jointly optimize explainability, trust, and auditability.
C. Blockchain for Federated Learning
Blockchain integration in federated learning [5] provides
decentralized coordination, incentive mechanisms, and
tamper-proof audit trails. BlockFLA [14] proposes a
consortium blockchain for federated learning with smartcontract-based aggregation verification. TrustChain [15]
combines reputation systems with blockchain logging for
Byzantine-robust aggregation. FLChain [16] optimizes onchain storage using Merkle trees and off-chain computation.
Lin et al. [22] and Al-Sulami et al. [19] emphasized the role of
blockchain-based trust in medical and industrial applications,
showing how distributed ledgers enhance transparency. Recent
work by Zhang et al. [17] explores blockchain-based XAI
logging but lacks adaptive trust mechanisms. FedXChain
uniquely combines blockchain auditability with trust-weighted
explainability aggregation, bridging the gap between
transparency and interpretability in heterogeneous federated
settings.

D. Gaps and Motivation for FedXChain
Despite advances in federated optimization, explainability,
and blockchain integration, no existing framework
simultaneously addresses (1) privacy-preserving aggregation
of local explanations, (2) quantification and preservation of
node-specific interpretability, (3) adaptive trust-based
weighting informed by explainability quality, and (4)
immutable audit trails for XAI artifacts. FedXChain fills this
gap by integrating these components into a unified system,
enabling participants to verify aggregation fairness,
understand global model decisions, and maintain local
explanation fidelity.

EVALUATION METRICS

A. Performance Metrics
We evaluate model performance using validation accuracy
(Val Acc), which measures the global model’s predictive
quality on held-out data. For federated settings, we also track
per-client local accuracy to assess personalization and fairness
across heterogeneous nodes.
B. Explainability Quality Metrics
XAI Fidelity Proxy: We define fidelity as the correlation
between the global model’s intrinsic feature importance (e.g.,
logistic regression coefficients) and the aggregated SHAPbased feature importance. High fidelity indicates that the
federated explanation accurately reflects the model’s learned
weights. Formally, fidelity = corr(|coef|, mean|SHAP|).
Node-Specific Divergence Score (NSDS): NSDS
quantifies the divergence between a node’s local SHAP
distribution and the global aggregated SHAP distribution
using KL divergence: 𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆𝑖 = 𝐾𝐿(𝑃local ∥ 𝑃global ), where 𝑃
are normalized absolute SHAP value distributions. Lower
NSDS indicates that the node’s local explanations align well
with the global consensus, while higher NSDS suggests that
adaptive aggregation should preserve the node’s unique
interpretability.
C. Trust and Fairness Metrics
Trust Score: Each node’s trust score is computed as a
weighted combination of accuracy, XAI fidelity, and
consistency across rounds: Trusti = 𝛼 · Acci + 𝛽 · Fidelityi + 𝛾
· Consistencyi . This composite metric informs adaptive
aggregation weights.
Reward-Trust Correlation: To evaluate the incentive
mechanism, we measure the Pearson correlation between node
rewards (computed based on contribution quality) and trust
scores. Positive correlation indicates that the reward system
aligns with trust-based aggregation.
D. System Metrics
Blockchain Verification: We verify the integrity of audit
trails by checking hash consistency across rounds. Each
round’s XAI artifacts (global SHAP, local SHAP, NSDS, trust

www.etasr.com

Vol. XX, No. X, 20XX, XXXXX-XXXXX

3

scores) are hashed and chained, ensuring tamper-proof
logging.
Aggregation Overhead: While not the primary focus of this
simulation study, we track the relative overhead of secure
aggregation (simulated via additive masking) compared to
baseline FedAvg.
V.

FEDXCHAIN METHOD AND ARCHITECTURE

A. System Overview
FedXChain integrates four core components: (1) local
training with SHAP-based explanation generation at each
node, (2) secure aggregation of both model parameters and
SHAP values using simulated additive masking, (3) trust score
computation and adaptive weighting based on accuracy,
fidelity, and consistency metrics, and (4) blockchain logging
of aggregation artifacts for auditability. Each federated
learning round proceeds through client selection, local update,
explanation extraction, secure aggregation, trust evaluation,
adaptive weighting, global model update, and blockchain
recording.
B. Federated-SHAP Aggregation
At each round 𝑡, participating nodes 𝑖 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐶t train
local models on their private data and compute SHAP feature
(𝑡)
importance vectors 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓 𝑠𝑖 . To preserve privacy, we
employ secure aggregation: each node generates a random
(𝑡)
mask 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓 𝑚i , shares masked values 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑠𝑖 + 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏
𝑓 𝑚𝑖 , and after aggregation the masks cancel out, yielding the
(𝑡)
true weighted sum 𝑠𝑢𝑚i 𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑑𝑎i 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑠𝑖 without
exposing individual SHAP distributions. The global SHAP
vector is then normalized and stored on-chain as a hash for
verification.
C. Node-Specific Divergence and Adaptive Trust
For each node 𝑖, we compute NSDS as
𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝐾𝐿(𝑃𝑖 I𝑃𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 ) where 𝑃 are normalized SHAP
distributions. Nodes with high NSDS represent unique local
patterns that should not be overshadowed. The trust score 𝑇𝑖 =
𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎𝐴𝑖 + 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎𝐹𝑖 + 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎𝐶i combines accuracy 𝐴i, fidelity
𝐹i, and consistency 𝐶i (variance of metrics over recent rounds).
Adaptive aggregation weights are then 𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑑𝑎i 𝑝𝑟𝑜 𝑝𝑡𝑜𝑇i(1 –
𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆i), balancing trust with the preservation of diverse
explanations.
D. Blockchain Audit Trail
After each aggregation, the system computes a
cryptographic hash of the round’s artifacts: global model
parameters (hash of weights), global SHAP vector, all nodes’
NSDS values, and trust scores. This hash is appended to the
blockchain, linking to the previous round’s hash, forming an
immutable chain. Participants can verify integrity by
recomputing hashes and checking chain consistency, ensuring
that no aggregation step has been tampered with retroactively
E. Algorithm Workflow
The high-level workflow is as follows:

Engineering, Technology & Applied Science Research

1. Server broadcasts global model 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑤 (𝑖) to selected
clients 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑐𝑎𝑙𝐶t .
2. Each client 𝑖 performs local training for 𝐸 epochs,
(𝑡)
computes local SHAP 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑠𝑖 , and sends masked
updates.
3. Server aggregates model updates and SHAP values (masks
cancel).
4. Server computes NSDS for each client and updates trust
scores.
5. Server calculates adaptive weights 𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑑𝑎𝑖 and updates
global model 𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑤 (𝑡+1) .
6. Server logs round artifacts to blockchain and broadcasts
𝑚𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑏 𝑓𝑤 (𝑡+1) .
This workflow ensures that every round’s aggregation is
transparent, auditable, and informed by both performance and
explainability quality.

THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

A. Convergence Guarantee
Theorem 1 (Trust-weighted Convergence). Under the
following assumptions:
1 𝑛𝑖
1. Local loss functions 𝑓𝑖 (𝐖) = ∑𝑗=1
ℓ(𝒘; 𝑥𝑗 , 𝑦𝑖 ) are 𝐿𝑛𝑖

smooth and 𝜇-strongly convex.
2. Trust
scores
𝑇i
are
lower-bounded:
𝑇i ≥ 𝑇min > 0 for all 𝑖 ∈ Ct.
𝑇 (1−𝑁𝑆𝐷𝑆𝐼 )
3. Adaptive weights satisfy 𝜆𝑖 = ∑ 𝑖
with NSDSi
< 1.

𝑗∈𝐶𝑡 𝑇𝑗 (1−NSDS𝑗 )

Then, the global model converges to a neighborhood of the
optimum with rate :
1
𝜎2
𝔼[𝑓(𝐰 (T) )] − 𝑓 ∗ ≤ 𝑂 ( +
)
𝑇 𝜇𝑇min
where 𝜎2 bounds the variance of local updates and 𝑇 is the
number of rounds.
Proof Sketch: The trust-weighted aggregation 𝐰 (𝑡+1) =
∑𝑖 𝜆𝑖 𝒘(𝑡)
𝑖 can be viewed as a weighted average of gradient
descent steps. By smoothness and strong convexity, each local
step contracts the distance to optimum. The trust lower bound
𝑇min prevents degenerate weights, ensuring sufficient
exploration. The (1 – NSDSi) term adaptively downweights
divergent nodes, reducing aggregation bias. Standard federated
optimization analysis [4] then yields the stated convergence
rate.
B. NSDS Stability and Privacy
Proposition 1 (NSDS Bounded Divergence). For secure
aggregation with additive masking, the revealed global
(𝑡)
SHAP 𝒔(𝑡) = ∑𝑖 𝜆𝑖 𝑠𝑖 satisfies:
1
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖 𝐾𝐿( 𝑃𝑖 ∥ 𝑃global ) ≤ 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑑) + 𝑂 (
)
[𝐶𝑡 ]

Vol. XX, No. X, 20XX, XXXXX-XXXXX

4

where 𝑑 is feature dimensionality, ensuring that no single
node’s SHAP distribution can dominate the global view
beyond logarithmic divergence.
Justification: KL divergence is upper-bounded by the log
of support size plus the variance term. With weighted
averaging and |Ct| ≥ 𝑘min participants, the law of large numbers
ensures convergence of the aggregate distribution, limiting
individual node influence. This provides a privacy guarantee:
an adversary observing the global SHAP cannot reverseengineer individual s𝑖 beyond what is revealed by the
aggregate structure.
C. Complexity Analysis
Per-round computational complexity :
• Local training: O (𝐸 · 𝑛𝑖 · 𝑑) for 𝐸 local epochs, 𝑛i
samples, 𝑑 features.
• SHAP computation: O (𝑛sample · 2𝑑 ) for exact SHAP
on 𝑛sample instances (exponential in 𝑑; mitigated by
sampling approximations).
• Secure aggregation: O (|C𝑡| · 𝑑) for mask
addition/cancellation.
• Trust and NSDS: O (|C𝑡| · 𝑑) for divergence and
score computation.
• Blockchain logging: O(1) hash computation per
round (amortized write cost depends on blockchain
platform).
Total server-side complexity per round is 𝑂 (|𝐶𝑡 | · 𝑑) ,
linear in the number of clients and features, which is scalable
for moderate |𝐶𝑡 | and 𝑑.
D. Threat Model and Security
We consider the following adversarial scenarios:
1. Honest-but-curious server: The aggregation server
follows the protocol but may attempt to infer individual
SHAP values. Secure aggregation with additive masking
ensures the server only observes ∑𝑖 𝜆𝑖 𝑠𝑖 , not individual 𝑠𝑖 .
2. Malicious clients (Byzantine): A subset of clients may
send arbitrary updates to poison the global model. The
adaptive trust mechanism down-weights nodes with low
accuracy or fidelity, providing robustness. However, full
Byzantine tolerance requires additional defenses (e.g.,
robust aggregation, anomaly detection)—future work.
3. Blockchain tampering: An adversary may attempt to alter
past aggregation logs. The cryptographic hash chain
ensures tamper-evidence: any modification breaks hash
consistency, detectable by all participants.
Our system assumes a majority of honest participants and
does not yet defend against coordinated Sybil attacks or
gradient inversion; these are acknowledged limitations for
production deployment

H. Results Analysis
Table 1 presents comparative results across three
scenarios: FedAvg (baseline with IID data), FedProx (with
non-IID data and proximal term), and FedXChain Adaptive
(our approach with non-IID data and trust-based adaptive
aggregation). FedAvg achieves the highest validation accuracy
on IID data, as expected, since uniform data distribution
minimizes client drift. However, under non-IID conditions
(Dirichlet 𝑎𝑙 𝑝ℎ𝑎 = 0.5 for FedProx and 𝑎𝑙 𝑝ℎ𝑎 = 0.3 for
FedXChain), performance degrades. FedXChain’s adaptive
aggregation recovers much of this loss by dynamically
weighting nodes based on trust scores, achieving competitive
accuracy while maintaining lower NSDS.
Explainability metrics reveal key insights. FedXChain
exhibits higher XAI fidelity compared to FedProx in non-IID
settings, indicating that trust-based weighting preserves
alignment between global model parameters and aggregated
SHAP explanations. The average NSDS for FedXChain is
lower than FedProx, suggesting that adaptive aggregation
better preserves local interpretability: nodes with high localglobal divergence are weighted appropriately, preventing their
unique explanations from being overshadowed by the
majority. Figures 1–3 illustrate trends over training rounds,
showing stable convergence of accuracy, gradual reduction in
NSDS as nodes align, and increasing trust scores for highperforming clients.
The reward-trust correlation (Fig. 7) is strongly positive,
validating the incentive mechanism: nodes that contribute
high-quality updates (high accuracy, fidelity, and consistency)
receive proportionally higher rewards. This alignment
encourages honest participation and discourages free-riding or
malicious behavior. The blockchain audit trail successfully
verified all rounds’ integrity, with hash chain consistency
maintained throughout the experiment. Secure aggregation for
Federated-SHAP adds minimal overhead (not shown in detail
due to simulation scope), demonstrating feasibility for
production deployment.

we conduct ablation experiments by removing modules

Table II shows that removing NSDS reduces XAI fidelity
by 8%, as nodes with divergent explanations are overaggregated. Removing trust scores drops validation accuracy
by 5% in non-IID settings, confirming that trust-based
weighting mitigates low-quality contributions. Blockchain
removal does not affect accuracy or fidelity but eliminates
auditability—a qualitative loss not captured by numerical
metrics. Secure aggregation overhead is negligible (< 2%
computation time increase), validating its practical viability.

yields the best balance: maximizing validation accuracy while
preserving high XAI fidelity. Over-emphasizing consistency

adaptability.

VIII. CONCLUSION
FedXChain demonstrates that adaptive trust-based
aggregation with federated explainability and blockchain audit
trails can balance global accuracy with local interpretability.
The integration of SHAP-based feature importance
aggregation with node-specific divergence scoring provides a
principled approach to preserve both global consensus and
local explanation fidelity. Our experiments show that trustinformed weighting outperforms uniform aggregation
(FedAvg) and proximal regularization (FedProx) in non-IID
settings, achieving competitive accuracy while maintaining
higher XAI fidelity and lower node-specific divergence. The
blockchain audit trail ensures transparency and tamperproof
logging, addressing trust concerns inherent in decentralized
learning.
Despite these contributions, several limitations and
opportunities for future work remain. First, our current
simulation uses logistic regression as the model; extending to
deep neural networks will require efficient SHAP
approximations (e.g., DeepSHAP, GradientSHAP) and
handling higher-dimensional parameter spaces. Second, secure
aggregation is simulated via additive masking; production
deployment should integrate cryptographic protocols such as
secure multiparty computation or homomorphic encryption [3]
to provide formal privacy guarantees. Third, blockchain
scalability remains a challenge for large-scale deployments
with hundreds of nodes and frequent rounds; off-chain storage
with on-chain hashing or layer-2 solutions may mitigate
overhead. Fourth, the trust score weighting scheme assumes
benign but heterogeneous participants; adversarial robustness
against model poisoning or Byzantine attacks warrants further
investigation. Finally, real-world validation on diverse
domains (healthcare federated records, IoT sensor networks,
financial fraud detection) is essential to assess practical impact
and tune hyperparameters ( 𝑎𝑙𝑝ℎ𝑎, 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎, 𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑎) for
domain-specific requirements.
Future research directions include: (1) extending
FedXChain to support personalized federated learning where
each node maintains a personalized model alongside the global
model, (2) incorporating differential privacy budgets into the
trust score to balance privacy-utility tradeoffs, (3) dynamic
client selection strategies informed by NSDS and trust to
optimize communication efficiency, (4) multi-objective
optimization frameworks that jointly optimize accuracy,
fairness, explainability, and privacy, and (5) human-in-theloop interfaces for node operators to inspect and validate
aggregation decisions via the blockchain audit trail. By
addressing these directions, FedXChain can evolve into a
comprehensive platform for trustworthy, explainable, and
privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning.
